      can be modified in order to add the following line :
       AS_JAVA=/home/user/local/jdk1.8.0_xx

Installation
------------

0) Download Cerberus package 

1) Setup Cerberus Database

- create a user and associated schema inside mysql

CREATE USER 'cerberus'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'toto';
GRANT USAGE ON * . * TO 'cerberus'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'toto';
GRANT USAGE ON * . * TO 'cerberus'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'toto';
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `cerberus` ;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `cerberus` . * TO 'cerberus'@'%';

- modify 00Config.sh file with your local parameters.

2) Application Server Configuration. We made the choice to use glassfish 

- run installation script --> 01AppServerConfig.sh[.bat]

3) Deploy Cerberus Application

- run deploy script --> 02DeployApp.sh[.bat]

4) You can connect to cerberus and start using it.
  http://localhost:8080/Cerberus/
 - Default Logins to the Cerberus Web Interface :
  admin / admin for administrator access
  cerberus / cerberus for standard user access
 - The first connection to the application will initialise the database so it may be a bit slow (be patient during the update of the database).
 
Before starting a test case, you need a selenium server running. 
You can get the selenium jar file from http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/
You can use the start-selenium.sh script in tools/selenium/ folder. Update it in order to use the proper jvm and selenium jar.

Script execution automation can be done using the scripts located in tools/batchexecution/.
 
NB : don't forget to update the cerberus parameters according to your Environment --> parameter page in Admin menu needs to be changed according to your local config.
2 parameters are mandatory in order to start :
  - cerberus_mediastorage_path parameter : in order to store the various execution media files (ex : /home/pete/cerberus_media/) inside the correct local folder. This is where Cerberus will try to store the files xml, json or images taken during the execution.
  - cerberus_applicationobject_path : in order to store the various object files (ex : (ex : /home/pete/cerberus_objects/))
