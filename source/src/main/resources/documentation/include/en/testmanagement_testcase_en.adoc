=== TestCase attributes
|=== 

| *Field* | *Description*  

| Test | Test name on which testcase is linked.

| Testcase | An ID.

| Description | Define if the test is active.

| Application | The application for which the testcase is defined.

|=== 

=== Create TestCase 

. Go to *[red]#TestCase -> TestCase List#*. image:testcasecreate.png[CreateTestCase,250,250,float="right",align="center"]
. Click on *[red]#Create TestCase#*.
.. Feed the *[red]#Test#* field with the test name.
.. Feed the *[red]#Description#* field with a short description of this test.
.. Continue to describe.
.. Click on *[red]#Save#*.

=== Implement TestCase

==== Step

. Click on *[red]#Add step#* to display the following window.  image:testcasepage.png[TestCasePage,250,250,float="right",align="center"] 
. Feed a *[red]#Description#* and click on *[red]#Add#* for a new step. 
. Or search for a step in library then click on *[red]#Add#*.

image:testcaseaddstep.png[testcaseaddstep]

Your step is created. if you want to put it in library, just click on the book on the right side.
A step in library will be available to add it in all test cases of your current system.

image:testcasesteplibrary.png[testcasesteplibrary]

In the following screenshot you can see a use step. This step is imported from the previous library step.
You are not able to modify it (all fields are grey). But you can find a link at the top to open the library if you want to modify your step. All use steps from this library will be impacted by your modification.

To modify only this use step, you have to click on the padlock icon but it will not be a use step anymore. (modification on library step will not affect it)

NOTE: You have the possibility to switch the position of your steps by clicking on the 3 dots.

==== Property

When Clicking on Button image:buttonmanageproperties.png[buttonManageProperties], the Window "Manage Properties" will open.
From there you can :

* either manage your TestCase properties
* or see your inherited properties - coming from the step libraries of your use steps.

image:windowmanageproperties.png[windowManageProperties]

|=== 

| *Field* | *Description*  

| Property | Name of the property.

| Type | The way the property is going to be calculated.

| Value | Value of the property.

| DB | DataBase in which the property will "executeSql".

| Length | When calculating a list of values, defines the number of rows the property will return.

| Row Limit | When returning a list of values, limits the number of rows the property will consider for random purposes.

| Nature | Defines the unique value that will be used in the execution. By default, STATIC has no rules defined : it will take the first result it finds.

| Desription | Description of the property.

| Countries | Countries for which the property will be calculated (environment parameter).

|=== 

==== Variables

You can use variables in the action and control's values.
These variable are define in cerberus and you can have access to them with the right syntax.

A variable is defined between %

The easiest way to feed an action with a property or an object, is to use the auto-completion :

. *[red]#Create#* your *property* or your *application object [red]#in advance#*
. *[red]#Type#* "%"
. *[red]#Select#* property or object
. *[red]#Select#* property-name or object-name
. If it's an object, *[red]#select#* its value / picture path / picture url

image:testcasevariables.png[testCaseVariables]

These syntax are available:

. %property.myproperty% : Get the property myproperty
. %object.myobject.value% : Get the application object myobject's value
. %object.myobject.picturepath% : Get the application object myobject's picture path
. %object.myobject.pictureurl% : Get the application object myobject's picure url
