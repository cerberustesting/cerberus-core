=== TestCase attributes
|=== 

| *Field* | *Description*  

| Test | Test name on which testcase is linked.

| Testcase | An ID (alphanumeric caracter).

| Status | Used to implement a workflow and gives way to filter Testcase.

| Active | Boolean that defines if the Testcase can be launched.

| Short Description | Provide a brief introduction about the Testcase.

| Application | The application for which the testcase is defined.

| Function | Another categorization field.

| Priority | Assign to any of its execution a certain importance to calculate the CI score.

| Detailed Description | Provide more detail about the Testcase. Isn't visible in reports.

| Comment | Should be use in addition with the short description to give temporary comment.

|=== 

The Activation Criterias defines condition to enable/block the Testcase to be launched in specific context (countries, environment...). This level of specification is the most important (override all the others conditions)

A Testcase can be linked to multiple Labels depending on their assigned system (see labels section)

=== Create TestCase 

. Go to *[red]#TestCase -> TestCase List#*.
. Click on *[red]#Create TestCase#*.

image:testcasecreate.png[CreateTestCase,250,250,float="right",align="center"]

Only the following field are mandatory:

.. Feed the *[red]#Test#* field with the test name. (a default value should be selected)
.. Modify the *[red]#Testcase ID#* if necessary (it can be modified after, but the according execution history will be lost)
.. Select the *[red]#Application#*
.. Continue to describe
.. Click on *[red]#Save#* as soon as you're done.

=== Implement TestCase

==== Step

. Click on *[red]#Add step#* to display the following window.  image:testcasepage.png[TestCasePage,250,250,float="right",align="center"] 
. Feed a *[red]#Description#* and click on *[red]#Add#* for a new step. 
. Or search for a step in library then click on *[red]#Add#*.

image:testcaseaddstep.png[testcaseaddstep]

Your step is created. if you want to put it in library, just click on the book on the right side.
A step in library will be available to add it in all test cases of your current system.

image:testcasesteplibrary.png[testcasesteplibrary]

In the following screenshot you can see a use step. This step is imported from the previous library step.
You are not able to modify it (all fields are grey). But you can find a link at the top to open the library if you want to modify your step. All use steps from this library will be impacted by your modification.

To modify only this use step, you have to click on the padlock icon but it will not be a use step anymore. (modification on library step will not affect it)

image:testcaseusestep.png[testcaseusestep]

NOTE: You have the possibility to switch the position of your steps by clicking on the 3 dots.

==== Property

When clicking on Tab image:buttonmanageproperties.png[buttonManageProperties], the Property menu will appear.
From there you can manage your TestCase properties or see your Inherited Properties - coming from the step libraries of your use steps.

image:windowmanageproperties.png[windowManageProperties]

|=== 

| *Field* | *Description*  

| Property | Name of the property.

| Type | The way the property is going to be calculated.

| Value | Value of the property.

| DB | DataBase in which the property will "executeSql".

| Length | When calculating a list of values, defines the number of rows the property will return.

| Row Limit | When returning a list of values, limits the number of rows the property will consider for random purposes.

| Nature | Defines the unique value that will be used in the execution. By default, STATIC has no rules defined : it will take the first result it finds.

| Desription | Description of the property.

| Countries | Countries for which the property will be calculated (environment parameter).

|=== 

==== Property Types

|=== 

| *Field* | *Description* | *Example*  

| text | assign the property an alphanumeric value. Can invoke other properties | `%system.EXECUTIONID%_test`

| getFromDataLib | query the corresponding datalib (identified by its name) | `Datalib_Name`

| getFromSQL | run a specific query an get the first, and only the first, result. The DB must be specified | `select TestCase from testcasestepactioncontrol where Control = 'verifyElementInElement'`

| getFromJS | Execute the specified JavaScript script without getting any output | `var xPathRes = document.evaluate ("//*[@data-cerberus='button_basket_ProductBloc_modifyProduct1']", document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null); xPathRes.singleNodeValue.click();`

| getFromJson | JSON path to get a certain element from a service call | `$.status`

| getFromXml | Xpath to get a certain element from a service call | `//OrderId/text()`

| getFromGroovy | Execute the specified Groovy script and get the last defined variable | `'%property.date%'.replace('\','-').substring(0,10)`

|===

===== SQL queries management:

- queries can be stored inside the test case and launched using getFromSQL. Only one value of the first row can be retrieved.

- queries can be stored inside a Datalib, according to its DB. Several values of the first row can be retrieved.

We recommend the Datalib since its simplifies the modification of any request, if some queries can be re-used.

===== Service management:

A service must be referenced in Service Library

- it can be called using the callService property, parsing will be performed using properties (getFromJson, getFromXml)

- it can be stored in a datalib and all the field will be parsed using the Subdatas.


==== Variables

You can use variables in many area of Cerberus. Those variable are used in order to perform some actions of controls in a dynamic way.
3 types of variables can be created :

- Variables defined from **properties** inside Test Cases.
- Variables defined from **application object**.
- **System** Variables

Properties and Application Object are defined by the users while system variable are provided by Cerberus.

The global syntax of a variable is :
%[property|object|system].nameOfTheVariable%

This is the list of fields in Cerberus where you can use those variables.

- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Test Case level.
- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Step Test Case level.
- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Action Test Case level.
- Condition Value1 and Value2 at Control Test Case level.
- Test Case Action Value 1 and Value 2.
- Test Case Control Value 1 and Value 2.
- Test Case Properties Value 1 and Value 2.
- Path, Envelope and Method at Test Data Library (SOAP) level.
- SQL Script at Test Data Library (SQL) level
- Column, Parsing Answer and Column Position at Test Data Library Subdata definition level
- Path, Request, Operation and Attachement URL at Service level.
- Request detail (all keys and values) and Header (all keys and values) at Service level.

When a variable is detected in one of those field, Cerberus will replace it by the value during the execution.

- If the variable is an object, the value (that never change) is just replaced.
- If the variable is a system variable, the value is calculated and replaced at the same time (for ex : time will be the time of the replacement).
- If the variable is a property, it gets automatically calculated at the time of the replacement. If was already calculated before, the same value (already calculated) is replaced.
NOTE: In order to force the calculation of a property at a certain timing, _calculateProperty_ Action can be inserted just before the action is used in a field.

Variables can be defined in a recursive way.
That means that the following syntax :

%property.%system.country%% will be first replaced by

%property.FR% and then by FR property value (if it exist).

Please note also that, if at the end of the decode operation, there are still references to %property.???% or %system.???% or %object.%%% in the field, the corresponding test case will report an error and generate an FA status.

===== Property Variables

Property variable allow to have multi row content.
As a consequence the full syntax will look like this :

%property.NameOfTheVariable.rowNb.SubData%

If rowNb is not defined, the 1st row will be used. As a consequence, the syntax %property.rowNb.nameOfTheVariable% is the same as %property.1.nameOfTheVariable%

If SubData is not defined, the key velue subdata will be used.

===== Object Variables

- %object.myobject.value% : Get the application object myobject's value
- %object.myobject.picturepath% : Get the application object myobject's picture path
- %object.myobject.pictureurl% : Get the application object myobject's picure url

===== Tricks

You will find below some tricks which help you to implement specific test cases.

NOTE: It is possible to create a random property with a number of digit defined. You have to feed the property fields like the screenshot below. This property will be different for each execution. Example: 884592, 004795
image:testcaserandomproperty.png[TestCaseRandomProperty]

NOTE: It is possible to loop over a step using the following configuration.
image:testlooptep.png[TestCaseLoopStep]

==== Robot Constrains

You can define Robot constrains at testcase level in order to force the execution a specific testcase with a specific UserAgent or ScreenSize.
This is used to test some specific behaviour of a website for a given UserAgent or ScreenSize.
You can tune the list of UserAgent and ScreenSize proposed in autocomplete mode (on the GUI) by modifying the respective public invariant USERAGENT and SCREENSIZE.

UserAgent and ScreenSize will be defined at execution level following the rule :

|=== 

| *TestCase* | *Robot / Execution* | *UserAgent Result*   
| UserAgent1 |	| UserAgent1
|  | UserAgent2 | UserAgent2
|  |	| user Agent unchanged
| UserAgent1 | UserAgent2 | UserAgent1

|=== 

|=== 

| *TestCase* | *Robot / Execution* | *ScreenSize Result*   
| 1024*768 |	| 1024*768
|  | 640*360 | 640*360
|  |	| Fullscreen
| 1024*768 | 640*360 | 1024*768
