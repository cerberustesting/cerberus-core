|=== 
Will upload a file to a folder located on the robot side. That allow to implement use case where a file needs to be uploaded from the robot side to the tested application.

*[blue]#Value1#* : Full name of the target file on the robot side.

*[blue]#Value2#* : Content of the file to upload. (in plain text or base64 format)

*[blue]#Value3#* : Option in order to trigger a specific behavior. _EMPTYFOLDER_ will empty the folder where the file is located in order to secure that its selection is to be performed in the exact same way (more and more files appearing on the folder may make its selection quite complex).

.Upload a file
====
*[blue]#Value1#* /home/seluser/Downloads/test.json

*[blue]#Value2#* {"content" : "test"}

*[blue]#Value3#* 

Will dynamicaly create the file /home/seluser/Downloads/test.json on the robot side with content '{"content" : "test"}'
====

.Upload a file and empty the folder content before.
====
*[blue]#Value1#* /home/seluser/Downloads/test.json

*[blue]#Value2#* eyJjb250ZW50IiA6ICJ0ZXN0In0K

*[blue]#Value3#* EMPTYFOLDER

Will dynamicaly purge the content of /home/seluser/Downloads/ and then create the file /home/seluser/Downloads/test.json on the robot side with content FILE1
====

[TIP]
====
In order to encode the content of a file to Base64, you can use a tools such as https://base64.guru/converter

==== getRobotFile
|=== 

| *[green]#GUI#* | *[red]#SRV#* | *[red]#APK#* | *[red]#IPA#* | *[green]#FAT#* | *[red]#BAT#*

|=== 
Will get a list of files located on the robot side. That allow to implement use case where you want to test the content of a file downloaded on the robot side from the tested application.

*[blue]#Value1#* : Filename pattern to download.

*[blue]#Value2#* : number of files to download.

*[blue]#Value3#* : Option in order to trigger a specific sorting behavior when selecting the files.

* *_LASTMODIFIED_* will sort files by latest modification time, 
* *_IGNORECASEDESC_* will sort them in descending order by name ignoring case.
* *_IGNORECASEASC_* will sort them in ascending order by name ignoring case.
* *_DESC_* will sort them in descending order by name.
* *_ASC_* will sort them in ascending order by name. (this is the default value)

The Action will return a json file that follow the below json format:

[NOTE]

Please note that on the above example, the 1st file is a pdf file and the 2nd a json file that contain:

    {"content": "test"} 
====

.get 2 files
====
*[blue]#Value1#* /home/seluser/Downloads/*.json

*[blue]#Value2#* 2

*[blue]#Value3#* LASTMODIFIED

Will get the last 2 json files from /home/seluser/Downloads/ on the robot side.
====

.get 1 file.
====
*[blue]#Value1#* /home/seluser/Downloads/test.json

*[blue]#Value2#* 

*[blue]#Value3#* 

Will get /home/seluser/Downloads/test.json file on the robot side.

==== calculateProperty
|=== 

| *[green]#GUI#* | *[green]#SRV#* | *[green]#APK#* | *[green]#IPA#* | *[green]#FAT#* | *[green]#BAT#*

|=== 
Will allow you to calculate a *[red]#Property#* defined in the property section of the test case and optionally update the content using the definition of another property. That action should only be used if you need to force a calculation at a precise timing or if you want to recalculate it with the latest value. A property calculation is automatically triggered when using a property without being forced to use that action.

*[blue]#Value1#* : Name of the property to calculate. If the property is already calculated, it will be forced to be calculated again.

*[blue]#Value2#* : [Optional] Name of a second property whose definition will be used to affect the property in *Value1*.

==== setNetworkTrafficContent
|=== 

| *[green]#GUI#* | *[red]#SRV#* | *[green]#APK#* | *[green]#IPA#* | *[green]#FAT#* | *[red]#BAT#*

|=== 
Retrieve the network traffic from Cerberus Robot Proxy (when activated at robot level) and calculate a json message that can be used for direct controls on all attached controls. If Robot Executor is not activated, Action will end in NE Status and all attached controls ignored. Once all controls of that action are finished, current content are set back to normal value (could be an html or app page or another service).

*[blue]#Value1#* : URL to filter. Network requests will be filtered based on that value. Any url that contain the value1 will be included in the network traffic.

*[blue]#Value2#* : [Optional] Flag in order to include the response content of every requests. For speed and performance reason, Cerberus by default will not retrieve the content of every requests. If you want to get them in order to perform some controls on them, you can use that flag.

[NOTE]
====
This action is only possible when Robot has the Cerberus executor activated and fully working.
It also require at least version 1.1 of the executor.
====

==== indexNetworkTrafficContent
|=== 

| *[green]#GUI#* | *[red]#SRV#* | *[green]#APK#* | *[green]#IPA#* | *[green]#FAT#* | *[red]#BAT#*

|=== 
Allow to index the network traffic content into pieces. This action allows, during a testcase, to define some checkpoint that will isolate the traffic statistics done before and after the index. When the action is triggered, Cerberus save the number of requests performed since the beginning of the testcase in order to index them. When at least an index exist on a testcase, the 'Network' tab displayed inside the testcase execution report allow to filter the various dashboard on a selection of indexes.
When that action is performed, the 'setNetworkTrafficContent' action and 'getFromNetworkTraffic' default to the content that occured since that last index created.
That action is handy in order to perform a full end user scenario (ex : a customer going through a checkout) and perform control on traffic done only on some isolated part of the scenario. Thanks to that action I can validate that a certain hit has been done on a specific part of the testcase (ex : no hits perfomed during the payment page loading.)

*[blue]#Value1#* : Name of the index.

[NOTE]
====
This action is only possible when Robot has the Cerberus executor activated and fully working.
It also require at least version 1.1 of the executor.
====

==== setServiceCallContent
|=== 

| *[green]#GUI#* | *[green]#SRV#* | *[green]#APK#* | *[green]#IPA#* | *[green]#FAT#* | *[green]#BAT#*

|=== 
Force current content of the test case on the last service call in a JSON format. That JSON will allow controls on the structure of the last call for both Request and Response including information such as http header, http protocol version, or return code. Any control attached to that action will take json path as element syntax for direct controls. If no calls were performed before that action, action will end in NE Status and all attached controls ignored. Once all controls of that action are finished, current content are set back to normal value (could be an html or app page or another service).

==== setConsoleContent
|=== 

| *[green]#GUI#* | *[red]#SRV#* | *[red]#APK#* | *[red]#IPA#* | *[red]#FAT#* | *[red]#BAT#*

|=== 
Force current content of the test case to the console logs in a JSON format. That JSON will allow controls on the all the logs collected between each call to that action (logs contents are reset after each call to get them). Once all controls of that action are finished, current content are set back to normal value (could be an html or app page or another service).

==== setContent
|=== 

| *[green]#GUI#* | *[green]#SRV#* | *[green]#APK#* | *[green]#IPA#* | *[green]#FAT#* | *[green]#BAT#*

|=== 
Force current content of the test case to the data provided in value1 parameter. It can be any format you need (JSON, XML). All controls attached to that action will point to that data. Once all controls of that action are finished, current content are set back to normal value (could be an html or app page or another service).

==== lockDevice
|===

| *[green]#APK#* | *[green]#IPA#*

|===
Lock the device during the execution

==== unlockDevice
|===

| *[green]#APK#* | *[green]#IPA#*

|===
Unlock the locked device during the execution. For APK, capabilities unlockType et unlockKey can be used to unlock devices protected by a key.

==== rotateDevice
|===

| *[green]#APK#* | *[green]#IPA#*

|===
Rotate the screen 90 degrees.

==== doNothing
|=== 

| *[green]#GUI#* | *[green]#SRV#* | *[green]#APK#* | *[green]#IPA#* | *[green]#FAT#* | *[green]#BAT#*

|=== 
Just perform no action. No action will be executed and engine will go to the next action or control

==== mouseOverAndWait
DEPRECATED Action that should no longuer used.

==== removeDifference
DEPRECATED Action that should no longuer used.
